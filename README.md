What is pgp.asc?
=======

pgp.asc is an initiative to decentralize public PGP keys, making it easier to get an up to date and authenticated key.

Sounds complicated? It isn’t: Just upload your public PGP key to your websites root folder and you’re good to go!

Why should I?
=======

To make it easier to find your public PGP key, and immediately validate it. (Since only you have access to your server) To provide an up to date key, as you can delete your old one. To spread the word about encryption.

How can I help?
=======

We need help with everything, ranging from Front-End and Design over Back-end to Copywriting. If you think you can provide help, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request!
